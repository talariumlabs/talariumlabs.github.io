          <h1 class="title is-3">Meet the Founder</h1>
          <p>I founded Talarium Labs after completing a PhD in Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania. I also hold an MSc in Computer Science from the University of Oxford and a BS in Mathematics from Florida State University. My research focuses on building systems that are correct, reliable, and durable under stress. Now, Talarium is bringing that same mindset to emergency communication.</p>
